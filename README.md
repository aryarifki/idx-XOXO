# 📈 IDX Bandarmology — Smart Money Tracker for Indonesian Stocks

An end-to-end data pipeline for testing a simple question:

> **Do large-broker accumulation signals and foreign flow actually align with stronger IDX stock returns, or are they mostly trader folklore?**

The project is built around a notebook-first workflow, with a separate Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration and portfolio-ready screenshots.

---

## What this project demonstrates

A single, end-to-end project that exercises the **full data lifecycle** — built to show practical **Data Engineering**, **Data Analysis**, and **Data Science** skills in one place.

| Role | What I built here |
|------|-------------------|
| 🛠️ **Data Engineer** | End-to-end **ETL pipeline** ingesting two live sources (yfinance OHLCV + an authenticated broker-flow API), cleaning and landing them into a **SQLite analytics warehouse**; **incremental multi-day backfill** that turns broker *snapshots* into a time series; a modular, reusable Python package (`config` · `broker_api` · `prices` · `storage` · `pipeline` · `features`) with secrets handled via `.env`. |
| 📊 **Data Analyst** | A **6-tab interactive Streamlit dashboard** with KPI cards, filters and drill-downs; **visual storytelling** (price/signal context, broker-flow comparison, profile grouping, broker-to-broker distribution, event studies); business framing that turns anonymous broker codes into *"who is actually accumulating"*. |
| 🔬 **Data Scientist** | **Feature engineering** (forward/backward returns, smart-money features); **statistical inference** (OLS with HAC/Newey–West robust errors, one-sided significance tests with multiple-testing awareness); **Granger causality** for lead/lag (statsmodels); **classification models** (logistic regression & random forest) scored with precision, recall & ROC-AUC; and an **event-study** framework. |

**Tech stack:** Python · pandas · NumPy · statsmodels · scikit-learn · SQLite · Streamlit · matplotlib · yfinance · Jupyter

## The story behind this project

It started with a question every Indonesian retail investor eventually asks: **does "smart money" really exist on the IDX, or is *bandarmology* just folklore?**

I went looking with **BULL** (PT Buana Lintas Lautan), a company transforming into **LNG shipping**. After taking delivery of its first LNG carrier — **MT Gas Garuda (145,914 CBM)** in December 2025 — BULL planned three more LNG vessels in H2 2026 (~US$125M capex) into a market projected to need **140–155 new LNG carriers by 2027**, with analysts expecting its net profit to roughly *triple* in 2026 and brokerages such as NH Korindo initiating a **BUY (target price 800)**.

Fundamentally the story looked strong. Yet in early June the Indonesian market sold off hard and **BULL fell ~57%, from around 610 to 258** — which looked less like broken fundamentals and more like global sentiment and weak market conditions dragging the valuation down. So I asked:

> **If the business story is still strong, would any broker quietly accumulate it at a cheaper price — and if so, who?**

To answer that I built a pipeline to track flow broker-by-broker. One code kept showing up: **Broker II**, with **more than Rp 105 B cumulative net buy** over the window — a line that just kept climbing while retail-heavy brokers like **XL** sold or chopped around. That relentless, price-insensitive buying is the classic fingerprint of a **"bandar."**

Broker code **II** maps to **PT Danatama Makmur Sekuritas** — and Danatama is not just any broker on this stock. It shares the **same address** as BULL (*Danatama Square II*); **Halim Jusuf** is President Commissioner of *both* Danatama and BULL; his son **Henry Jusuf** is BULL's President Director and a former Danatama director; and Danatama-linked entities collectively hold **~5.6% of BULL's shares**. (A broker code only shows the *executing* broker, not the final client — this is a data-driven research lead, **not** an accusation.)

That curiosity became this end-to-end project, following one loop:

> **raw data → SQLite warehouse → Streamlit dashboard → feature engineering → modeling → testable hypothesis**

And the first real lesson it taught me: **the biggest broker is not always the most predictive one.** On BULL, II was the most *persistent* accumulator — but statistically a smaller broker (**GA**) carried the stronger forward-return signal. The same pipeline also surfaced signals in other stocks, including **BREN**. Both cases are below.

## Architecture

![Pipeline architecture — yfinance + broker data flow through the pipeline into a SQLite warehouse, then into the notebook / dashboard and the modeling layer](docs/screenshots/pipeline_flowchart.png)

Each module is intentionally small and reusable on its own under `src/idx_bandarmology/`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd idx-bandarmology
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set `BROKER_API_TOKEN`.

## About `BROKER_API_TOKEN`

The broker/bandar data comes from a private, authenticated broker-data endpoint, so you need to supply your own session token from an account that already has access. Capture the bearer token your own logged-in session sends to that endpoint, then paste it into `.env`:

```bash
BROKER_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Treat this token like a password: keep it private and never commit `.env` (it is already in `.gitignore`). Without the token, price data still loads, but broker and bandar data are skipped.

## Main workflow: notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_bandarmology_end_to_end.ipynb
```

Run the notebook from top to bottom. It covers:

1. Pipeline execution with yfinance and the broker-flow endpoint.
2. Raw table inspection from SQLite.
3. Feature engineering.
4. Descriptive analysis and correlation checks.
5. OLS regression and simple classification models.
6. A plain-English verdict summary.

Edit the watchlist in the notebook to track different stocks:

```python
WATCHLIST = ["BBCA", "BBRI", "BMRI", "BBNI", "TLKM", "ASII", "UNVR", "GOTO", "BREN", "ANTM"]
```

Important: the broker-flow endpoint provides a latest snapshot, not a historical archive. To build a usable time series, run the pipeline on multiple trading days.

## Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard reads the same SQLite warehouse as the notebook, so both views stay in sync. From the sidebar you choose a **universe**, a **focused ticker**, an **analysis date**, a **lookback window**, and the **validation horizon** / **minimum-event** thresholds — and can trigger a fresh pipeline run or a historical backfill in place. Headline metric cards (conviction score, signal, 5D return, foreign net flow, top buyer, smart-money cumulative flow) sit above six tabs:

- **Overview** — price / volume / signal context for the focused ticker, the day's top net buyers and sellers, multi-timeframe price performance, the smart-money daily flow, and the broker profile net flow.
- **Broker Flow** — a broker drill-down with a multi-broker **cumulative flow comparison**, the **broker profile flow** grouping, and an estimated **broker-to-broker distribution** (sankey).
- **Causality Insight** — Granger-causality tests for whether foreign flow (in aggregate, by participant type, and broker-by-broker) statistically *leads* price.
- **Validation** — the broker-specific return validation table (events, mean/median forward return, win rate, net buy, significance) plus an accumulation event-study chart.
- **Screener** — a cross-watchlist scan that ranks tickers and brokers by their validated accumulation signal, so the strongest leads surface automatically.
- **Raw Tables** — the underlying window-level broker-flow and broker-activity rows.

## Broker behavioral profiles — smart money vs. retail

Raw broker codes are anonymous, so before anything else the pipeline **groups every executing broker into a behavioral profile** and then nets their flow by group. This is what powers the *"who is really accumulating?"* read — separating conviction money from the crowd:

| Profile | What it represents |
|---------|--------------------|
| 🟢 **Foreign Smart Money** | Directional foreign institutions with higher conviction |
| 🔵 **Local Institutions** | Local funds and institution-like accounts |
| 🟣 **Market Makers** | Active on both sides — the *net* position is what matters |
| 🟠 **Speculative Operators** | Higher-risk, momentum / "gorengan"-style participants |
| ⚪ **Retail-Dominant** | Retail-heavy platforms, often late or contrarian |

In the dashboard, **"Smart Money" = Foreign Smart Money + Local Institutions**. The Overview tab's **Broker profile flow** panel shows net buy/sell for each group on the selected day, and the Broker-Flow tab's **Smart-money daily flow** chart sums only those two smart-money groups.

> These are **heuristic behavioral buckets** inferred from broker-code patterns, not official classifications — they describe how a desk *tends* to trade, not the identity of any end client.

## Results

The case studies below follow the same path as the write-up that started this project: a deep dive on **BULL** (the origin story), then a shorter look at **BREN** (the strongest *statistical* signal). Every figure is a real export from the dashboard — point it at any other ticker and the same panels regenerate.

### Main case study — BULL: "if the story is strong, who is buying the dip?"

The dashboard's **Overview** for BULL frames the puzzle in one screen. The aggregate read is **Accumulation** with a **conviction score of 60.9/100** and a positive short-term move (**+4.35% over 5D, +28.86% over 10D**), yet **foreign net flow is negative** and smart-money cumulative flow is **−Rp 160.85 B** over the window. The banner says it plainly: *accumulation conflicts with foreign net selling — check whether the move is driven by local brokers.*

![BULL Overview — conviction, signal, price/volume context, top brokers and profile net flow](docs/screenshots/bull_overview.jpg)

So if foreign desks aren't behind it, **who is?** The **Broker Flow** tab answers by plotting each broker's *cumulative* net buying across the window. One line just keeps climbing: **Broker II**, to **> Rp 105 B** — adding relentlessly while a retail-heavy broker like **XL** drifts lower. That price-insensitive, one-directional accumulation is the classic fingerprint of a **"bandar."**

![BULL broker-flow comparison — Broker II climbing to over Rp 105 B while retail brokers sell](docs/screenshots/bull_broker_flow_comparison.png)

The full Broker Flow tab nets every code into behavioral profiles and reconstructs who traded against whom, so a single climbing line becomes a structured read of *which kind of money* is on each side:

![BULL Broker Flow tab — profile grouping and broker-to-broker distribution](docs/screenshots/bull_broker_flow.jpg)

#### Who is Broker II? Connecting the flow to the "bandar"

Broker code **II** maps to **PT Danatama Makmur Sekuritas**, and the public record makes this more than a coincidence:

- Danatama shares the **same address** as BULL — *Danatama Square II*.
- **Halim Jusuf** is **President Commissioner of both** Danatama Makmur Sekuritas **and** BULL.
- His son, **Henry Jusuf**, is BULL's **President Director** and a **former Danatama director**.
- Danatama-linked entities collectively hold **~5.6% of BULL's shares**.

> **The hypothesis this surfaces:** the most persistent "bandar" accumulating BULL is routing through a broker **affiliated with BULL's own controlling owners** — i.e. the patient smart money on this stock may be connected to the insiders themselves. A striking, *testable* lead that the pipeline produced automatically from raw broker codes.

> ⚠️ **Observational hypothesis, not an allegation.** A broker code identifies the *executing member firm*, not the end client, so it cannot prove who actually traded — many unrelated clients can route orders through the same broker. There is **no public evidence** that any specific director or insider placed these trades. The value here is methodological: broker-flow data turned an anonymous code into a named, affiliated counterparty worth investigating with proper disclosures.

#### Not all brokers are equal — volume ≠ skill

Persistence is not the same as predictive power. Ranking every broker by *how its repeated net-buying of BULL was followed by forward returns* (≥5 events, positive mean, one-sided p < 0.05 to flag as significant) separates real edge from noise — and the most *persistent* broker is not the most *predictive* one:

| Broker | Net-buy events | Win rate | Mean 10-day fwd return | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **GA** | 11 | **73%** | **+15.48%** | **0.0053** | ✅ yes |
| II | 38 | 50% | +3.77% | 0.0642 | ❌ no |
| ZP | 37 | 46% | — | 0.1171 | ❌ no |
| SQ | 35 | 49% | — | 0.0822 | ❌ no |

> Lower-volume broker **GA** carried a genuine, statistically significant edge (p = 0.0053 ≈ 99.5% confidence), while the three biggest-volume brokers on the stock (II, ZP, SQ) had roughly coin-flip win rates. Across the whole watchlist, **17 broker–ticker combinations** passed the significance filter. BULL stays interesting to monitor — especially with a rights-issue story ahead.

### Other signals — BREN's statistically strongest broker

The same pipeline, pointed at **BREN** (Barito Renewables), produced the cleanest *statistical* result in the warehouse. Among every broker that repeatedly net-bought BREN, foreign broker **BK** stands out: **13 net-buy events, a +21.59% average 10-day forward return, a 69% win rate, and p = 0.0122** (significant at the 5% level).

![BREN Overview — price, signal, top brokers and smart-money flow](docs/screenshots/bren_overview.png)

The broker grouping tells the rest: over this window **Local Institutions** were the dominant net buyers (**+Rp 871 B**), with retail-heavy platforms adding **+Rp 245 B**, while **Market Makers (−Rp 417 B)** and **Foreign Smart Money (−Rp 564 B)** were net sellers — a reminder that an "Accumulation" tape can still have large foreign desks distributing underneath it.

> Scope & reproducibility: these are snapshots produced by `notebooks/01_bandarmology_end_to_end.ipynb` and `dashboard/app.py` against the same SQLite warehouse (window ending 2026-06-22). A short history, a small watchlist, and multiple-testing risk make these findings **exploratory, not production trading signals** — re-running on a longer history will shift the exact numbers. See the Disclaimer at the bottom.

### Under the hood: causality & broker-level validation

Two analytical layers sit behind the case studies above, surfaced in the dashboard's **Causality Insight** and **Validation** tabs:

- **Granger causality** (`statsmodels`): for the focused ticker it tests whether foreign net flow — in aggregate, by participant type, and broker-by-broker — *precedes and predicts* price over the next few days, rather than merely moving with it on the same day (p < 0.05 flags a significant lead).
- **Broker-specific return validation** (`broker_alpha_scan`): for every broker that repeatedly net-bought the ticker it reports event count, mean/median forward return, win rate, and a one-sided significance test, applying the same "≥5 events, positive mean, p < 0.05" bar — driven by a configurable horizon and minimum-event threshold.

Both layers run **per focused ticker** — the BULL and BREN cases above are produced by changing the **Ticker** selector and nothing else.

## Methodology

- **Historical returns**: `back_return_5d` measures how much the stock moved over the last 5 trading days up to the signal date.
- **Forward returns**: `fwd_return_5d` measures how much the stock moves over the next 5 trading days after the signal date.
- **Smart money features**: bandar detector score, foreign broker net, foreign flow, and volume-based context.
- **OLS regression**: checks whether signal variables have statistically significant relationships with returns.
- **Classification models**: turn returns into a binary up/down target and report accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Granger causality**: tests whether lagged foreign flow improves the prediction of price beyond price's own history — a directional ("leads") check rather than a same-day correlation.
- **Broker-specific validation**: ranks individual brokers by the statistical significance of the forward returns that follow their repeated net buying, flagging only accumulators that clear the one-sided test.

With a short history and a small watchlist, results are exploratory rather than production-grade trading signals.


## Perubahan dibanding repo awal

Berdasarkan riwayat Git pada branch ini, baseline repo awal berada di commit `6059891` (**Added Dev Container Folder**), dan perubahan setelahnya saat ini berada di commit `8a921f9` (**Daily pipeline + BI export Wed Aug  5 20:07:26 UTC 2026**).

### Ringkasan perubahan

Perubahan yang diterapkan sejak repo awal hanya terjadi pada **2 file data hasil pipeline/BI export**:

1. `data/bi_daily_signals.csv`
2. `data/bi_price_metrics.csv`

### Detail perbedaan

- **Tidak ada penambahan file baru** dibanding baseline.
- **Tidak ada penghapusan file** dibanding baseline.
- **Tidak ada perubahan kode** pada modul Python (`src/`, `scanner/`, `dashboard/`) maupun workflow (`.github/workflows/`).
- Perubahan bersifat **pembaruan data output harian** (refresh dataset) dari proses pipeline otomatis.

### Implikasi

- Struktur proyek, arsitektur, dan logika aplikasi tetap sama seperti repo awal.
- Perbedaan saat ini merepresentasikan **snapshot data terbaru**, bukan perubahan fitur atau refactor kode.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add automatic scheduling for daily pipeline runs.
- [ ] Add broader market universes such as IDX30 or LQ45.
- [ ] Add a walk-forward backtest for simple signal rules.
- [ ] Add a more production-oriented BI layer if needed.
